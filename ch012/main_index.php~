Your neighbour is a technical helper in that company, he recently found that the company is cheating people and somehow collecting people's creditcard details. Before informing the police, the company's database should be deleted,else they would get alerted and copy database to somewhere else.<br /> So knowing you to be a hacker, he rushes to you, narrates you everything.Thinking that it may help you,he says that he has seen programmers of that website work in a folder named 'scripts' present in the root directory. Can you handle the task and delete the database?
